Mock Website for a Monthly PC Part Delivery Service (think kinda like Lootcrate!)

Obviously, the available plans would not be suitable for the real world, nor would their prices be as cheap as a they are, but I think this would be a genuinely interesting business plan for a company that tailors to a unique audience. I've had some PC hardware experience, so this came to mind when generating an idea for a mock website.

Uses React, Bootstrap, and Material-UI.
